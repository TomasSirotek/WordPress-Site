PHP functions like get_post and looping through out the posts and replacing static content with PHP.

Creating simple button with PHP and WP(link) with opening site on the new page and assigning specific URL.

#### Problems I ran Into & Solutions

I was dealing with problem uploading SVG files into the site. 
From the article provided from tutor and information given by WP site (Blocked due security reasons) I found out its not good to use SVG files because its taken as a document file and creates many vulnerabilities for attackers. (XSS attack)
But for this learning process I just simply installed pluggin called "Safe SVG".
